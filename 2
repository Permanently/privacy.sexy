Show error on AV removal on desktop $264, $304

This solves $264 where users do not get error messages when running
script file fails due to antivirus intervention (it being blocking the
script file as soon as privacy.sexy generates it to run it). Now if the
desktop app users tries to save or run a script file and it afils due to
antivirus removal, they'll get a special error message with guiding next
steps.

- Add additional check to able to fail if the file writing fails. This
  includes trying to reading the written file back as suggested in $304.
  This successfully detects antivirus (Defender) intervation as read
  file operation triggers the antivirus scan that deletes the file.
- Show directory and file path in error messages as suggested in $304.
- Show an error message with more detailed information if an antivirus
  is detected.
